   * First of all.
   * Satya G Meka aka Rowbyte is the only one out of
   * Element 3D, Form and Plexus
   * who seems to get the obj import right
   * I didn't try the atomkraft plugins.
   * Element 3D and Form fail with the OBJ files created
   * E3D needs faces to import an obj and then the scale is strange.
   * Its pretty wired.
   * Form does also not get the AE world right back in.
   * No offense I love E3D and Form but
   * Plexus eats these OBJ files out of the box.
   *
   * But hey. Still have fun with that script.
   *
   *
   *
   * Videocopilot Element 3D Quirks:
   * - E3D needs faces in the obj. If there are only verticies he does not find anything at all
   * - E3D seems to read only positive values
   * - E3D scaleing is offseted
   * - E3D position is offseted
   * - E3D writing all v's to faces does not solve the problem so it is deactivated
   *
   * Trapcode Form Quirks:
   * - Form needs no faces. He finds the verticies
   * - better shut of normalize
   * - To get something that is near to but not fully right
   *   Set the Basefrom x to your obj comps x
   *   Set the Basefrom y to your obj comps y
   *   Set the Basefrom z to your obj comps z
   *   But still. It is not fully right.
   *   Fiddle with the z offset
   *   you need to offset the center z of the Base Form
   *
   * @todo calculate also rotation values und scales using a buffer layer with this expression
   * // apply to position of buffer layer
   * // works 2D and 3D
   * a = thisComp.layer("parented layer");
   * a.toWorld(a.anchorPoint);
   *
